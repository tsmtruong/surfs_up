# Surf's Up

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if running a surf and smoothie shop in Hawaii was sustainable year-round. If the surf shop idea was analyzed and determined profitable we would use the analysis to pitch the idea to investors to secure capital. For this analysis we used SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Pandas, and Numpy in Jupyter Notebooks to find and recreate databases and DataFrames.

## Results
June Temps

December Temps

- The temperatures from June and December did not record a large/significant difference in temperature. The average temperature in June was about 75° F where as the December average was 71° F
- The standard deviation of the temperatures between the two months shows that June had a standard deviation of 3.25 while December had a standard deviation of 3.75 showing a larger deviation of 0.5 on December
- The highs and lows on the two months vaired as well with June having a high of 85° F and a low of 64° F a temperature variance of 21°. December had a high of 83° F and a low of 56° F a larger temperature variance than June with a difference of 27°


## Summary
If only temperature were to be factored in the decision of wether or not a surf and smoothie shop should be opened, the analysis shows that per weather tmeperature patterns it would be a good idea as the average tmeperature for the two months have a very small difference. However, I do believe that in order to truly determine the possibility of success there would still need to be queries/analysis done on precipitation patterns as well as an aditional analysis on both precipitation and temperature specifically on the weather station that is the closest to the location in which the surf and smoothie shop would be opened, as temperatures can vary from location to location, especially if there are possible plans for expansion to mulitple islands.
